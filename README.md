# FTL-Multiverse-Judge-Blue-Options
This mod modifies the Node 17 judge event to turn options not yet shown to them blue.
Specifically, it removes the judge boon event and re-adds it.
Supports:
* Multiverse (5.5.1)
* Forgotten Diamonds (1.6.5)
* Forgotten Races (16.27)
* Forgemaster (0.6.1.2.2)
* Insurrection + Selection (5.5.1)
* C&C Weapons: Renegade (5.0)

* Darkest Desire (4.0.2)
* The Outer Expansion (7.1.8)
* Lily's Innovations (1.5.0)
* Expanded Multiverse (0.6.1)

Any other mods that also modify boons will need to be loaded after this mod.

Let me know about them and I can add support!

This mod should be loaded after the supported mods, but before any unsupported boon adders.

EX:
* Multiverse Assets/Data
* Forgotten Races Assets/Data <=(supported)
* Forgotten Races Diamonds <=(supported)
* Judge Blue Options <=(This mod)
* Some other boons mod <=(unsupported)
