# FTL-Multiverse-Judge-Blue-Options
This mod modifies the Node 17 judge event to turn options not yet shown to them blue.
Specifically, it removes the judge boon event and re-adds it.
Supports:
* Multiverse (5.5.1)
* Forgotten Diamonds (1.6.5)
* Forgotten Races (16.27)

* Lily's Beam Emporium (1.5.4)
* Expanded Multiverse (0.6.1)
* Alder's Additions (2.1.1)

Any other mods that also modify boons will need to be loaded after this mod.

Let me know about them and I can add support!

This mod should be loaded after the supported mods, but before any unsupported boon adders.

EX:
* Multiverse Assets/Data
* Forgotten Races Assets/Data <=(supported)
* Forgotten Races Diamonds <=(supported)
* Judge Blue Options <=(This mod)
* Some other boons mod <=(unsupported)
